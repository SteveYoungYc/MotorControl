**     Filename    : TI2.h
**     Project     : exp-the-motor
**     Processor   : MC56F8257
**     Component   : TimerInt
**     Version     : Component 02.161, Driver 02.06, CPU db: 3.00.239

**     Date/Time   : 2021-05-31, 16:21, # CodeGen: 57
**     Abstract    :
**         This component "TimerInt" implements a periodic interrupt.
**         When the component and its events are enabled, the "OnInterrupt"
**         event is called periodically with the period that you specify.
**         TimerInt supports also changing the period in runtime.
**         The source of periodic interrupt can be timer compare or reload
**         register or timer-overflow interrupt (of free running counter).
**     Settings    :
**         Timer name                  : TMRA1 (16-bit)
**         Compare name                : TMRA1_Compare
**         Counter shared              : Yes
